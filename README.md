# Adjusting 2025 German Election Poll Predictions Based on 2021 Errors

## Overview

This analysis aims to adjust the 2025 German election poll predictions by incorporating the discrepancies observed in the 2021 election. By doing so, we attempt to correct potential biases present in the current polling data, improving the reliability of our forecasts.

## Methodology

1. **Collect Poll Data**  
   We gathered polling data from various institutes for both the 2021 and 2025 elections.

2. **Calculate Polling Errors (2021)**  
   We compared the 2021 poll predictions with the actual election results to identify the biases of each polling institute.

3. **Adjust 2025 Predictions**  
   We applied the 2021 polling errors to the 2025 predictions by adding/subtracting the differences from the latest 2025 poll figures.

4. **Compute Aggregate Adjusted Predictions**  
   We averaged the adjusted predictions across all institutes to generate a more robust estimate.

5. **Visual Representation**  
   We visualized the adjusted predictions with error bars to reflect uncertainty.

6. **Assess Differences Between First and Second Place**  
   We calculated the maximum and minimum possible differences between the top two parties across all polling institutes to understand potential election outcomes.

## Purpose & Justification

This adjustment is crucial because raw polling data may be subject to systematic biases. Our method accounts for these errors to improve prediction accuracy and provide a more realistic picture of the upcoming election.

## Potential Sources of Error in Polling

- **Timing and Data Fluidity**: The election is just one week away, meaning voter sentiment may still shift significantly.
- **Changes in Polling Methodologies**: We do not know whether polling institutes have adjusted their methodologies after the errors observed in 2021.
- **Sampling Bias & Nonresponse Issues**: Some population subsets may be over- or underrepresented in polls, a challenge observed in other democracies, such as the United States.
- **Comparability Between Elections**: The 2021 election exhibited significant volatility, with last-minute swings in voter preference. In contrast, the 2025 election appears more stable, with fewer major shifts in polling trends over the past months.

## Conclusion

By correcting for biases from the 2021 election, we aim to create a more refined projection of the 2025 election outcome. However, given the uncertainties in polling methodologies and voter behavior, our adjusted forecasts should still be interpreted with caution.
